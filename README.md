# Fashion MNIST Image Classification with CNN

## Introduction

Welcome to the Fashion MNIST Classification project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This repository explores the world of fashion classification, utilizing CNNs to enhance the capabilities of image classification models in computer vision.

### Dataset Overview

Fashion MNIST, a challenging alternative to the handwritten digit MNIST dataset, consists of 70,000 grayscale images categorized into 10 different fashion classes. Each image is a 28x28 pixel representation of various clothing items, including shoes, shirts, and trousers.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to build and train a CNN capable of accurately classifying these fashion items. CNNs have proven to be exceptionally effective in image recognition tasks, making them a natural choice for this endeavor.

## Implementation

The project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Exploration:** Understand the structure and characteristics of the Fashion MNIST dataset.

2. **Model Architecture:** Design a Convolutional Neural Network architecture suitable for fashion classification.

3. **Training the Model:** Utilize the dataset to train the CNN, adjusting hyperparameters for optimal performance.

4. **Evaluation:** Assess the model's accuracy and performance on both training and testing datasets.

5. **Deployment:** Prepare the trained model for potential deployment and real-world use.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Fashion-MNIST-Image-Classification-CNN.git
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Explore the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to understand the implementation details.**

4. **Run the notebook or scripts to train and evaluate the CNN on the Fashion MNIST dataset.**
